# ScrPxlG

A small repository I'll use while working on [ScratchPixel](https://www.scratchapixel.com/).

Looking to gain basic rendering capabilities, from which I can generate some C++ image files.  The intent is to be able to use this framework in coordination with some basic scientific computation to be able to make some cool visuals of say, Monte Carlo integration, Markov chains, etc.
